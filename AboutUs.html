<center><h4 style="line-height: 40px;">Super_Mook_Mack and ToxicPomasto come all the way from second grade! These two boys came
    from the same school. They started playing different games and Super_Mook_Mack wanted to code.
    The reason he wanted to code was because his brother knows how to code and he thought it was
    really cool! So Super_Mook_Mack started off with his first coding language, Python. 
    After some coding ToxicPomasto
    discovered a platform while we were playing a game called "Scratch".
    When they signed up for Scratch we started playing other peoples' games. After
    about 10-20 minutes of about playing, they wanted to create their own games. They started
    making games, not knowing what they were doing. We eventually figured it out
    because I had used some of these statements in Python. For example: if, if else, repeat, while
    true, etc. Before they found out what Scratch was, they made a name for ourselves.
    This name was "Maleb Productions". After they made a couple games, Super_Mook_Mack's FIFA 16 Pack Opener got
    300+ views! ToxicPomasto's WWE Supercard pack opening game also got 900+ views! After a while on
    Scratch, Super_Mook_Mack figured out that a studio can be created. So he made the studio, put all my
    games in it, invited ToxicPomasto, and he put all his games in it. Super_Mook_Mack wanted to
    make a Twitter for their studio. He also wanted to create a website for our studio (He had
    learned HTML before this happened). Which is this website you're on right now. Now
    this leads us to where they are now!</h4></center>
